### Ivo Karlovic d. Horacio Zeballos (6-7(6) 3-6 7-5 6-2 22-20)

While most of the top players didn't have much trouble advancing on Day 2, Ivo Karlovic battled 5 hours and 15 minutes on Court 19 to earn his spot. It had to be a heart-wrenching loss when Horacio Zeballos lost after 42 games in the final set.  Both players were winning over 75% of points on serve which makes a marathon in the advantage set much more probable.

### Alex Zverev d. Robin Haase (6-2 3-6 5-7 6-3 6-2)

One of many fans dark horse for the tournament, Alex Zverev, had a battle in his debut match. After falling two sets to the veteran, Robin Haase, the young hopeful was able to turn things around. That kind of mental toughness has to be good indicator of a future of Major titles for Zverev.

### Heater Waston d. Sam Stosur (6-3 3-6 6-0)

It was another sad loss for Aussie Sam Stosur who has never had great success when playing at home. Heather Watson dropped a set but closed out the match with ease in the third.

### Lucie Safarova d. Yanina Wickmayer (6-3 7-6(7) 6-1)

Lucie Safarova had one of the toughest women's matches of the day, battling through three sets and a tiebreak in the second to earn her place in the next round. That win secured Safarova a second round match up against Serena Williams. Williams didn't drop a set but did show signs of vulnerability that could give Safarova the confidence to make it a match.
