The links below provide singles and doubles ratings based on the Game Insight Group (GIG) player ratings. These are a margin of victory based Elo rating system that accounts not only for the win result but also the game margin (games won minus games lost). Ratings are based on matches played above the Futures/ITF level, including qualifying and main draw matches. Surface-adjusted ratings weight all-surface and surface-specific ratings according to the correlation of each with win results and the surface in question. The lists show the top 100 players according to all-surface rating among players who have competed in at least one event in the past two years at the time of the last update.
